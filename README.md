# Discount Calculator (Vite + React)

This is a minimal Vite + React project that contains the Discount Calculator component.

Quick start:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Open the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173)

Notes:
- The main component is `src/DiscountCalculator.jsx`.
- The design uses CSS-in-JS (embedded <style> inside the component) and a small `src/index.css` for resets.
- Mobile responsive layout included.
